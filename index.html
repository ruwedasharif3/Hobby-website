                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p> Reading is a gateway to countless worlds, ideas, and experiences. It allows me to escape into different realities through fiction, or deepen my understanding of the world with non-fiction. Each book is an opportunity to learn something new—whether it's about history, philosophy, or human nature. Reading has not only helped me develop a broader perspective on life but also provided a constant source of inspiration and relaxation. It's my way of expanding my mind and feeding my curiosity.</p>

                <h3>Yoga</h3>
                <p> Yoga has been a transformative practice for me, both physically and mentally. It provides a balance between strength and flexibility, helping me stay fit while calming my mind. It’s a way to slow down, tune into my body, and find a sense of peace amidst the chaos of everyday life. Through regular practice, I’ve found a deeper connection to myself and a more mindful approach to living. Yoga isn’t just a workout; it’s a practice of self-care that nourishes my body, mind, and spirit.</p>

                <h3>Art</h3>
                <p> Drawing has always been a way for me to express my thoughts and emotions creatively. Whether it's capturing the beauty of nature, illustrating ideas, or simply doodling to relax, it’s a form of self-expression that brings me peace and joy. Through drawing, I can visually communicate what words often can’t, and it’s become a personal outlet for exploring my imagination and developing new skills.</p>
